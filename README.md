# TheraPerks
A therapist assist tool, which will allow said therapist to record their understanding of how a therapy session went, by imoji-answers, and get advice on how to improve their sessions.  

The secondary function of this app is to possibly collect that data and build an even better understanding of the interaction between a therapist and their client.
